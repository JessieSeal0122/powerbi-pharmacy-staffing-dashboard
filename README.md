# powerbi-pharmacy-staffing-dashboard

This project presents a Power BI decision support system designed to optimize outpatient pharmacy staffing based on real-time and historical data.  
It helps decision-makers determine appropriate pharmacist headcount across different time slots by forecasting the remaining prescription workload.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Pharmacy staffing decisions often suffer from unpredictability and underutilization of historical data.  
This dashboard integrates historical trends, real-time outpatient volume, and predictive analytics to support timely and data-driven staffing adjustments, aiming to avoid over- or under-staffing.

  - Average number of medication items per prescription (by physician/department)

- **Real-Time Monitoring**  
  Displays the number of patients currently in progress and those waiting to be seen, reflecting up-to-date outpatient demand.

- **Forecasting Engine**  
  Estimates the number of pending prescriptions and medication items by multiplying:
  - Each physicianâ€™s historical 30-day average:
    - Consultation rate  
    - Prescription rate  
    - Average number of drugs per prescription  
  - Ã— Real-time number of patients yet to complete consultation
