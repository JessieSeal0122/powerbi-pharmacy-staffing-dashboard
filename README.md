# powerbi-pharmacy-staffing-dashboard

This project presents a Power BI decision support system designed to optimize outpatient pharmacy staffing based on real-time and historical data.  
It helps decision-makers determine appropriate pharmacist headcount across different time slots by forecasting the remaining prescription workload.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Pharmacy staffing decisions often suffer from unpredictability and underutilization of historical data.  
This dashboard integrates historical trends, real-time outpatient volume, and predictive analytics to support timely and data-driven staffing adjustments, aiming to avoid over- or under-staffing.
